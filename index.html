	<center>Career Goals and such.</center>

	<p>I really don't have a whole lot in mind as far as career goals, finishing 
	   college in itself was always a major goal in my life. I really only want 
	   to make a better life for my children, and finishing college and getting 
	   a 'real job' seemed like the best way to do this.</p>

	<p>There are lots of things I could write here but probably won't.</p>
	<h3>Things I find ironic...</h3>
